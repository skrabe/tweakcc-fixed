With tweakcc, you can

- Create **custom themes** with a graphical HSL/RGB color picker
- Add custom **thinking verbs** that will show while Claude's working
- Create custom **thinking spinner animations** with different speeds and phases
- Change the "CLAUDE CODE" banner text to your own text with your own [figlet](http://www.figlet.org/) fonts
- Supports Claude Code installed on **Windows, macOS, and Linux**, using npm, yarn, pnpm, bun, Homebrew, nvm, fnm, n, volta, nvs, and nodenv, or a custom location
- Style the **user messages in the chat history** beyond the default plain gray text
- Remove the **ASCII border** from the input box

tweakcc also
- Restores the **token counter** and **elapsed time metric** that were shown during generation before Claude Code 1.0.83
- Fixes a bug where the **spinner animation** is frozen if you have the `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_NONESSENTIAL_TRAFFIC` environment variable set ([#46](https://github.com/Piebald-AI/tweakcc/issues/46))
- Allows you to **change the context limit** used with models from custom Anthropic-compatible APIs with a new environment variable, `CLAUDE_CODE_CONTEXT_LIMIT`

Additionally, we're working on features that will allow you to
- Pick from over **70+ spinning/thinking animations** from [`cli-spinners`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/cli-spinners)
- Apply **custom styling** to the markdown elements in Claude's responses like code, bold, headers, etc
- Customize the **shimmering effect** on the thinking verb: disable it; change its speed, width, and colors

Run without installation:

```bash
$ npx tweakcc

# Or use pnpm:
$ pnpm dlx tweakcc
```

## How it works

`tweakcc` works by patching the Claude Code's minified `cli.js` file.  When you update your Claude Code installation, your customizations will be overwritten, but they're remembered in your `~/.tweakcc/config.js` configuration file, so they can be reapplied by just rerunning the tool.

`tweakcc` is verified to work with Claude Code **1.0.128.**

## Running

Run with installing it with `npx tweakcc`.  Or build and run it locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Piebald-AI/tweakcc.git
cd tweakcc
pnpm i
pnpm build
node dist/index.js
```

## Troubleshooting

tweakcc maintains a backup of your Claude Code `cli.js` file for when you want to revert your customimzations, and also to reapply patches.  Before it applies your customizations, it restores the original `cli.js` so that it can start from a clean slate.  Sometimes things can get confused and your `cli.js` can be corrupted.  In particular, you may run into a situation where you have a modified `cli.js`, and then tweakcc takes makes a backup of that modified `cli.js`.  If you then try to reinstall Claude Code and apply your customizations, tweakcc will restore its backup of the old _modified_ `cli.js`.

To break out of this loop you can install a different version of Claude Code, which will cause tweakcc to make a new backup of the new `cli.js` file.  Or you can simply delete tweakcc's `~/.tweakcc/cli.backup.js`.  If you do delete `cli.backup.js`, make sure you reinstall Claude Code before you run tweakcc again, or else if `cli.js` is the modified version it, will again get into the loop described above.

## FAQ

#### How can I customize my Claude Code theme?

Run `npx tweakcc`, go to `Themes`, and modify existing themes or create a new one.  Then go back to the main menu and choose `Apply customizations to cli.js`.

#### Why isn't all the text in Claude Code is getting its color changed?

Some of the text Claude Code outputs has no coloring information at all, and unfortunately, that text is rendered using your terminal's default text foreground color and can't be customized.

#### Is there a way to disable colored output in Claude Code altogether?

Yes!  You can use the [`FORCE_COLOR`](https://force-color.org/) environment variable, a convention which many CLI tools including Claude Code respect.  Set it to `0` to disable colors entirely in Claude Code.

#### Why isn't my new theme being applied?

Could you have have forgotten to actually set Claude Code's theme to your new theme?  Run `claude` and then use `/theme` to switch to your new theme if so.

#### `tweakcc` vs. `tweakcn`...?

[`tweakcn`](https://github.com/jnsahaj/tweakcn), though similarly named, is unrelated to `tweakcc` or Claude Code.  It's a tool for editing your [shadcn/ui](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui) themes.  Check it out!
